# Piano Color Field

A lightweight static web app that visualizes MIDI input with color-mapped piano keys.

## Local preview
1. From the repo root, start a static server (example):
   ```sh
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8000 to load `index.html`.

## Pushing updates
If you have changes ready locally and a remote configured (e.g., `origin`):
1. Check status: `git status`.
2. Stage files: `git add <files>`.
3. Commit with a message: `git commit -m "Describe your change"`.
4. Push to the remote branch: `git push origin <branch>`.

If no remote exists yet, add one with `git remote add origin <git-url>` before pushing.
